"""
Simple script to add notes to a logfile from the command line.

The idea, that I read somewhere, is that a good engineer should keep logs of
what he does so that he can look at it later. It helps me quite a lot as I
regularly encounter a weird problem, knowing that I solved it earlier. But not
remembering what the solution was.

So either I have to write a blog entry about it so that I can find it in
google, or I need to add it to a simple text-based logfile somewhere. That's
what this script does.
