# Run some compile/create job from emacs' projectile

# I often want to run `make html` or an arduino compilation and so on the code. This
# script is coupled to `C-c c` in emacs, it is intended to work inside a projectile
# project.
#
# - If the environment variable `PROJECTILE_COMPILE` is set, run that
#   command. The direnv program can help you set it automatically.
#
# - If a makefile is present, `make` is run.
